## 1. Business Problem

House Rocket is a fictional real state company based in Seattle, USA. The business model of the company is first purchasing properties with good condition and bellow 
market's price, and then sell the properties with a profit margim. House Rocket leverages technology to find the best opportunities and at what price the real state
should be negotiated.

For this project, the business team has a large portfolio to evaluate and it would take to much time to do it manually. In addition, they've requested BI team to built a 
solution that both business team and C-Levels (i.e., CEO, CFO and COO) could analyze and take decisions.

Thus, BI team suggested that an online [dashboard](https://p001-house-rocket-insights.onrender.com/) was the best way to deliver the solution and the content must have:
* Quantity of real state;
* Total value invested;
* Total revenue;
* Total profit.

## 2. Business Assumptions

* In total, there were 21,613 properties available on the initial portfolio;
* Seasons of the year:
  * Spring runs from March 1 to May 31;
  * Summer runs from June 1 to August 31;
  * Autumn runs from September 1 to November 30;
  * Winter runs from December 1 to February 28 (February 29 in a leap year).
* The decisions were based on value invested and total profit. The profit margin was based on size and season, but condition, grade, location are also good indicators
of the best properties.
